# Short-Polar-Codes
This repository is the result of a set of experiments carried out on Polar codes and their modifications for short block lengths.
Short codes are useful for applications in 5G and beyond which require ultra reliability and low latency communication (URLLC).

This work is inspired by Arikan's 2019 Shannon Lecture and accompanying papers.

Note : The curves that indicate Modified Polar Codes are not Arikan's PAC codes.

This is a work in progress.
Simulation results beyond 2.75 dB are a little off the track due to lack of enough simulation samples.
That is why we will update the results as simulation progresses.
