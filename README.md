# Short-Polar-Codes
This repository is the result of a set of experiments carried out on Polar codes and their modifications for short block lengths.
This work is inspired by Arikan's 2019 Shannon Lecture and accompanying paper.

This is a work in progress.
Simulation results beyond 2.75 dB are a little off the track due to lack of enough samples.
That is why we will update the results as simulation progresses.
